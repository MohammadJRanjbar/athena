        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        {% include image.html url="./_images/athena_fwk.png" caption="" width=680 align="center" %}
        <p> Machine learning models have achieved human-level performance in many tasks, however, they are vulnerable to tiny imperceptible perturbations to its input. Such perturbed inputs are called <em>adversarial</em> examples. We propose Athena -- a framework for defending machine learning systems against adversarial attacks -- which ensembles various diverse weak defenses such as neural networks that were trained on disjointly transformed data. At test time, for a given input <strong><em>x</em></strong>, Athena first collects outputs from all weak defenses then uses some ensemble strategy (e.g., majority voting) to compute the final output. Athena is a defense framework that is (i) <em>extensible</em> so that one can add new weak defenses into or remove weak defenses from the framework anytime, (ii) <em>flexible</em> so that one can update the ensemble by replacing any weak defenses or ensemble strategy, and (iii) <em>general</em> so that one can use different type of machine learning models to train weak defenses.
