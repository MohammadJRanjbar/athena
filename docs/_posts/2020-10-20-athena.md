## Defense as a framework
Though deep learning systems have achieved impressive success in a wide range of domains like computer vision and natural language processing, they are highly vulnerable to adversarial examples. An adversarial example is an input artifact that is crafted from legitimate data by adding small and human-imperceptible perturbations, aiming to covertly force the deep learning system to produce an incorrect output. The vulnerability to adversarial examples can lead to a series of consequences, especially in security-critical tasks. For example, an object detector on a self-driving vehicle may incorrectly recognize an adversarial perturbed stop sign as a speed limit. 

In traditional machine learning, the test set is assumed to be drawn from an identical distribution of the training set. However, in adversarial machine learning, the defenders face an open-ended problem, in which an input can be an independent-identical-distribution (i.i.d.) sample (i.e., a legitimate sample) or an out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) sample (i.e., an adversarial example). Thus, research on adversarial defense is difficult. The threat of the adversarial examples has inspired a sizable body of research on various defense techniques. With the assumption on the specific known attack(s), most of the existing defenses, although effective against particular attacks, can be circumvented under slightly different conditions, either a stronger adaptive adversary or in some cases even weak (but different) adversaries. The "arms race" between the attacks and defenses leads us to this central question:

**`How can we, instead, design a defense, not as a technique, but as a framework that one can construct a specific defense considering the niche tradeoff space of robustness one may want to achieve as well as the cost one is willing to pay to achieve that level of robustness?`**

|![framework](./img/posts/athena_fwk_test.png){:width="460px" height="auto"}||To address the question, we propose **ATHENA** --- a framework for building an ensemble defense on top of a large population of *diverse* transformations. In this framework, each WD is an image classifier that was independently trained on a transformed dataset at the training phase. At the test phase, a WD first applies a transformation *`t`* on the original input **`x`** and then produces an output for the transformed input *`t`*`(`**`x`**`)`. Given an input **`x`**, an ensemble (i) first collects outputs from all WDs, and then (ii) uses an *ensemble strategy* such as majority voting and averaging outputs from WDs to compute the final output.|

## Ensemble based on diverse transformations

|Figure 2. Transformation as weak defense|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|Figure 3. Many diverse transformations can result in an effective ensemble|

In computer vision, a transformation is an image processing function. By distorbing its input, a transformation changes the adversarial optimized perturbations and thus making the perturbations less effective. However, the effectiveness of a single type of transformation varies on attacks and datasets. By mitigating the perturbations in different ways such as adjusting angles or position of the input, adding or removing noises, a collection of diverse transformations provides robustness against various attacks. Thus, the "Diverse" ensemble achieves the lowest error rate in most cases, especially for tasks on CIFAR-100. 

Ensembling diverse transformations can result in a robust defense against a variety of attacks and provide a *tradeoff space*, where one build a *higher robustness* ensemble by adding more transformation or build an ensemble with *lower overhead and cost* by utilizing fewer transformations.

## Results

### Zero knowledge threat model

|Figure 4. Evaulations of ATHENA and baseline defenses against various attack variants in the context of zero-knowledge threat model|

The effectiveness of individual WDs (each associated to a transformation) varies across attack methods and magnitudes of an attack. While a large population of transformations from a variety of categories successfully disentangle adversarial perturbations generated by various attacks. As presented in Figure 4., the variation of individual WDs' error rates spans wider as the perturbation magnitude become stronger for a selected attack. By utilizing many diverse transformations, with ATHENA, we build effective ensembles that outperform the two state-of-the-art defenses --- PGD adversarial training (PGD-ADT) and randomly smoothing (RS), in all cases.
