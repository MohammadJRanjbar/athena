## Abstract
There has been extensive research on developing defense techniques against adversarial attacks; however, they have been mainly designed for specific model families or application domains, therefore, they cannot be easily extended. Based on the design philosophy of ensemble of diverse weak defenses, we propose *ATHENA*---a flexible and extensible framework for building generic yet effective defenses against adversarial attacks. We have conducted a comprehensive empirical study to evaluate several realizations of *ATHENA* with four threat models including zero-knowledge, black-box, gray-box, and white-box. We also explain (i) why diversity matters, (ii) the generality of the defense framework, and (iii) the overhead costs incurred by *ATHENA*.

## Approach Overview

</div>
*ATHENA* is based on ensemble of many *diverse weak defenses* (WDs), where each WD, an essensial building block of the framework, is an image classifier that was independently trained on a transformed dataset at the training phase. At the test phase, a WD first applies a transformation on the original input *x* and then produces an output for the transformed input *t(x)*. Given an input *x*, an ensemble (i) first collects outputs from all WDs, and then (ii) uses an *ensemble strategy* such as majority voting and averaging outputs from WDs to compute the final output.

## Future Work
- *Integration with other defense machanisms*: By combining *ATHENA* with other defense techniques such as an adversarial detector, we can further improve the model's robustness.

- *Automated construction of ATHENA*: 

- *Building a hybrid*: Building a *hybrid framework* using optimizations on the space of (i) individual WDs, (ii) model types and architectures, and (iii) ensemble strategies is a fruitful direction for a future work.

- *Integration with cloud-based and edge-based environments*: *ATHENA* is flexible to be adopted and integrated with machine learning models within different contexts. For cloud-based services, it has the capability to be expanded by incorporating more WDs. For resource-constrained environments such as edge, *ATHENA* can be adjusted to incorporate a lower number of WDs and the ensemble strategy can be adjusted at deployment time, given the environmental conditions such as availability of resources, change in the behavior of adversaries, the toleration-level of attacks by the service providers, and the cost that the provider wants to impose upon to the attacker.
