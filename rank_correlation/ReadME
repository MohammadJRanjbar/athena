This directory contains scripts for analyzing rank correlation and dissimilarity (between BS and each AE type)
1. Rank Correlation:
   python rank_correlation_analysis.py <weak_defense_accuracy.csv> <result_dir> 

2. Calculate Disimilarity:
   python cal_dissimilarity.py <sample_dir> <result_dir>
   Note: <sample_dir> contains benign samples and all types of AEs in numpy file format. Each file has the dimension, (num_samples, image_length, image_width, num_channels)

3. Plot Disimilarity:
   python plot_dissimilarity.py <dissimilarity.csv> <result_dir>
