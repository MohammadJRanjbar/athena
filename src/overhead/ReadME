Plot the overhead:
   python overhead.py <result_dir>
   Note: the following files should be in the same directory where overhead.py locates
   1. transTCs.npy
      transformation time in each of 72 weak defenses
      shape of transTC: (72). 72 weak defenses
   2. predTCs.npy
      inference time in each of 72 weak defenses
      shape of predTC: (72). 72 weak defenses
   3. ensembleTCs.npy
      time cost of ensemble calculation
      shape of ensembleTC: (5). five ensembles
   4. predTCOnOriModel.npy
      inference time of the original model
