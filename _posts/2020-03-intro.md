# Athena: A Framework for Defending Machine Learning Systems against Adversarial Attacks

 ![framework](../_image/athena_fwk.png)
 
## Introduction
Machine learning models have achieved human-level performance in many tasks, however, they are vulnerable to tiny imperceptible perturbations to its input. We propose Athena -- a framework for defending machine learning systems against adversarial attacks -- which ensembles various diverse weak defenses such as neural networks that were trained on disjointly transformed data. At test time, for a given input $x$, Athena first collects outputs from all weak defenses then uses some ensemble strategy (e.g., majority voting) to compute the final output. Athena is a defense framework that is (i) __extensible__ so that one can add new weak defenses into or remove weak defenses from the framework anytime, (ii) __flexible__ so that one can update the ensemble by replacing any weak defenses or ensemble strategy, and (iii) __general__ so that one can use different type of machine learning models to train weak defenses.
